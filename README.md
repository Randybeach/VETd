## Overview
This application implements full C.R.U.D functionality, using Spring Data JPA, RESTful services, and Angular 8 to connect mentors with mentees. It was developed under Agile methodologies and is the result of a one week sprint.

## Program Purpose and Functionality
The purpose of this program is to connect veterans who have successfully navigated the career transition waters and have become subject matter experts in their field with transitioning veterans just begining their transition journey. Users can create an account as either a mentee or mentor. A mentee is able to choose sectors and jobs in which they would like to recieve mentorship. A mentor can select sectors and jobs in which they are subject matter experts review potential mentees who are also interested in those sectors. Once a mentor accepts a mentee chat is available to facilitate the relationship.  Once the mentor feels the mentee has been set on a successful path, they can release the mentee and leave a review.

## Login
Users are prompted to register as either a mentor or mentee and create a profile with basic information such as name and location. Upon creation, the user will be directed to their profile page where they can manage their account and add sectors and jobs of interest. For mentors, they will see a list of potential mentees.
